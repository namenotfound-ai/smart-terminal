# Smart Terminal with Local LLM Integration - Video Outline

## 1. System Requirements & Installation (5-7 minutes)
- Prerequisites:
  - Python 3.x
  - pip
  - Basic terminal knowledge
  - Note: Will include commands for users without brew, python, or conda
- Installation steps:
  - Clone the repository
  - Install required dependencies
  - Verify Python environment
  - Setup for default Mac users

## 2. Local Model Setup (3-5 minutes)
- Download and setup local model
- Explain the two versions (V1 vs V2)
  - V1 has less error handling
  - V2 includes improved error handling
- Show where to place model files
- Basic configuration
- Note: Can be fine-tuned with coding library (optional)

## 3. Starting the System (3-4 minutes)
- Start all three components in order:
  1. Local Model Server
  2. LLM Manager
  3. Smart Terminal
- Show how they communicate with each other
- Demonstrate the API endpoints
- Explain how multiple commands are handled:
  - Commands are returned in 1 request as JSON array
  - Executed in order
- Ensure API URLs match between components

## 4. Code Walkthrough (10-15 minutes)

### A. Local Model (local_model_v1.py & local_model_v2.py)
- Show basic structure
- Explain V1 vs V2 differences
- Highlight error handling improvements
- API endpoint implementation

### B. LLM Manager (llm_server.py)
- Show how it manages communication
- Explain the API structure
- Demonstrate error handling
- Show how it interfaces with the local model

### C. Smart Terminal (smart_terminal.py)
- **Important Safety Warning**
  - Explain the difference from Cursor's virtual workspace
  - Show the safety checks (is_command_dangerous function)
  - Emphasize that this runs on your actual system
  - Warning: This will actually edit your system
  - Safeguards prevent dangerous operations (e.g., "rm -rf /")
- Demonstrate command execution
- Show how it processes and validates commands
- Explain the command chaining functionality

## 5. Project Context & Future (3-5 minutes)
- Explain this is part of a larger open-source project
- Show how it demonstrates local AI capabilities
- Discuss the potential for different local models
- Explain how to experiment with different models
- Mention the project's goals and vision
- Highlight the inspiration: Building applications locally without permissions or internet connection

## 6. Closing (2-3 minutes)
- Quick recap of key points
- Where to find more information
- How to contribute
- Next steps for viewers
- Git repository information
  - Code attribution: Wendell's code with Caleb's tutorial
  - Repository access and contribution guidelines

## Technical Notes for Recording:
1. Have all three terminals ready to start
2. Prepare example commands to demonstrate
3. Have a safe test environment
4. Prepare error cases to show safety features
5. Have documentation ready to reference
6. Ensure all API URLs are properly matched
7. Prepare examples of command chaining
8. Have local model alternatives ready to demonstrate

```
def is_command_dangerous(command: str) -> bool:
    """
    Naive check for extremely dangerous commands.
    """
    lower_cmd = command.lower()
    if "rm -rf /" in lower_cmd:
        return True
    return False
```

For Caleb
- Understand how this calls multiple commands back to back. Are they returned in 1 request as json array and then exectued in order?

Next steps:
- how to fine tune with a coding library? - is it necessary?

Next
- Git polish
- Git commit and push
- Make a video: Objective is to keep this clean and show how to set up the env, download a local model, run a smart terminal, and show code you can explore. (tutorial for those without brew or python or conda?  Ask I to write up commands I may rely on that default mac does not have, so that anyone could use the smart terminal)

## Inspiration

Imagine being able to automate your smart terminal locally to build out applications - no permissions or internet connection required.
